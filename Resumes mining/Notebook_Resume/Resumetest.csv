While serving active duty in the United States Air Force, Chris inished a Bachelor’s of Science  in Industrial Technology with an emphasis in Manufacturing and Information Systems. The manufacturing environment provided access to Information Technology skills by networking machining centers and optimizing output. His earlier telecommunications exposure led to more work within the telecommunications industry by working for an Inter-connect and gaining PBX and outside plant wiring experience. The telecommunications experience segued into Information Technology networking. As a General Manager for an ISP, invaluable experience was realized from many available technologies of the time. It wasn’t until starting with Department of Energy Oice of Legacy Management, that Chris was  able to leverage all management, telecommunications, and networking experiences together. When Chris isn’t lying a hot air balloon, he can be found wrenching on old cars and motorcycles.

NARA Contract Program Manager Mr. Menzies,
Please accept this resume outlining my qualifications related to my current position as ZENworks Team Lead on the NARA contract. I request and appreciate your consideration in retaining my services going forward on the new contract.
I have over 20 years experience in information technology and business management. I received a Bachelor of Computer Science degree from Texas A&M University Central Texas in Killeen, Texas, as well as an Associate of Applied Science degree in computer science from Central Texas College in Killeen. I maintained a 4.0 grade point average while pursuing both degrees and graduated with highest honors from both institutions. I am a Novell Certified Engineer and Novell Certified ZENworks Administrator. From 1999 to 2012 I owned and managed a computer network solutions corporation that I co-founded.
In my career I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with a diverse demographic mix of people in varying IT environments. I am skilled in all tasks inherent in running an IT business, including recruiting, directing employees, project management, and customer relations. I have successfully managed projects with over 60,000 network users and 35,000 network nodes. I also maintain reseller partnerships with many top tier software and hardware manufacturers including Novell, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, VMWare, Kaspersky Labs, Astaro Corporation, SEP Software, Sophos Corporation, McAffee, and GWAVA Technologies.
Novell ZENworks Desktop Management and Novell ZENworks Configuration Management were a mainstay of my service offerings as a small business owner. I have personally handled installation and deployment projects for multiple customers including upgrades from earlier versions of ZENworks to the most recent ZCM releases. My experience includes creation and deployment of application packages, policies, and hardware images along with hands-on installation and administration of ZENworks inventory services and patch management.
I have been successful in positions requiring teamwork and collaboration. I am a self-starter equally comfortable with minimal supervision. I am highly competent with several operating system platforms and software packages including Novell Netware, Microsoft Windows, and SUSE Linux. I have extensive project management experience with Novell and Microsoft products, having designed, implemented, and administered Novell eDirectory and Microsoft Active Directory networks.
In my current position working on the NARA contract, I am responsible for directing all levels of ZENworks administration for an implementation encompassing more than 5000 workstations and 140 servers. I report directly to the program manager and coordinate the work of several employees shared between my team and the FOSA team. Under my leadership, the NARA ZCM implementation has been refined and is running at top levels of performance, particularly in regard to security patch implementation.
My experience along with my honors performance at the college level, as evidenced by my 4.0 CGPA, demonstrate that I will be a valuable asset to your organization. Please contact me at the address and phone number above if you have further questions for me. Thank you for your time and consideration.
